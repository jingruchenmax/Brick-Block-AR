# Brick Block AR
Bring the Oskar Stalbergs browser-based game [Brick Block](http://oskarstalberg.com/game/house/index.html) to life with the power of Augmented Reality using HoloLens! This project is a recreation of Eric Schubert's version of Brick Block, now with added AR capabilities.

# Version 1.0
This is the first release of Brick Block AR and includes the basic AR interaction and scaling of the game, based on head focus. The next release will feature eye tracking, making the experience more intuitive.
